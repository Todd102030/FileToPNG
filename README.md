FileToPNG
=========

File to PNG Encoder/Decoder

To encode a file into an image, run the command 

python encryption.py inputfile image.png


To decode an image into plaintext (or redirected into a file), run the command

python decryption.py image.png > filename

If you do not redirect the output into a file, it will just write to the terminal.
