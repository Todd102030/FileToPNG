FileToPNG
=========

File to PNG Encoder/Decoder

To encode a file into an image, run the command 

<code>python encryption.py inputfile image.png</code>


To decode an image into a file, run the command

<code>python decryption.py image.png outputfile</code>



Note: This is still quite buggy. There's some issues due to python not properly converting things like newlines and tabs, which can cause certain files to just not work.
